Package: libhadoop
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows 
 for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of 
 computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from 
 single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and 
 storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver high-availability, the 
 library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the application 
 layer, so delivering a highly-available service on top of a cluster of computers,
 each of which may be prone to failures.
